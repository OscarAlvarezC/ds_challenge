    "Este trabajo fue desarrollado con el lenguaje de programación Python, esto debido su orientación multipropósito y sus cualidades para el procesamiento de modelos iterativos.\n",
    "\n",
    "En en esta prueba técnica se desarrollarán nuevas Features con la intención de facilitar la clasificación de transacciones realizadas por defraudadores, cuidando errores de data leakage. Para dicha clasificación se implementarán los modelos de Machine Learning de XGBoost y LightGBM, modelos que han demostrado buenos resultados en problemas de esta índole. La target utilizada para el entrenamiento y prueba de los modelos fue el campo \"fraude\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Para la puesta en marcha productiva, se desarrollaron APIs con ayuda de las librerías de Flask. Su estructura se definió teniendo en consideración su integración a pipelines compartidos con otros departamentos, se buscó que los computos cuenten con persistencia para acceder a ellos posteriormente sin demandar recursos de procesamiento bajo mismas condiciones. Para este ejercicio se utilizó el sistema gestor de base de datos MySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Los resultados de los modelos y definiciones de punto de corte se basan en análisis de la curva ROC, métricas de AUC, estudio sobre aceptación-loss rate y ordenamiento de score."

    "- El modelo con mejor rendimiento, tomando en consideracion metricas de AUC, separabilidad entre clases e impacto económico fue el XGBoost, siendo \"dispositivo_anio\", \"hora\" y \"transacciones_ciudad\" las features que caracterizan con mayor fuerza si una transacción es fraudulenta o no, esto según los shaps obtenidos.\n",
    "- Se espera que con el modelo fijado a una aceptación del 80% se consiga disminuir el Loss Rate de un ~3.3% a un ~2.4%.\n",
    "- A pesar de que el modelo cuenta con bastantes áreas de oportunidad, presenta resultados consistentes y arroja un buen ordenamiento de score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Como siguientes pasos, habría que explorar la construcción de features adicionales a las aquí propuestas, en partícular aquellas limitadas al tiempo, en los shaps se puede ver que las features limitadas a las últimas 3 y 10 transacciones influyen considerablemente en el score. Features como el número de transacciones en los últimos $n$ días podrían ayudar bastante al modelo."
